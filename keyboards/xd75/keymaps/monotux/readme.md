# monotux's layout

This layout is basically a port of [svorak a5](http://aoeu.info/) to
the XD75 keyboard. As I have the bent steel case without any other
LEDs I have not bothered doing anything related to LEDs in my
layout. Please fork and improve upon this design!

The layout is designed to work with a normal Swedish layout.
